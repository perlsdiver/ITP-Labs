## COURSE DESCRIPTION

*Homelessness and Social Policy* is a policy elective that focuses on social policies that address homelessness. This advanced course extends the foundations of social welfare policy by deepening the knowledge obtained in SSW 701, applying it to a specialized issue or population group, and by developing the analytic skills needed to more critically synthesize and interpret the complexities of social welfare policy. Through online instruction, this course will explore policy dynamics, patterns, and changes that affect persons experiencing homelessness. This course examines social history, theories, frameworks, forces of oppression, and ethical issues that shape homelessness policy and practice today and provides a practical framework for policy analysis and action to give you the skills needed to promote policies that advance social and economic justice. Policy principles gained through this course can be generalized to other populations.

## COURSE FORMAT

**This is a fully online course.**

You will spend three and a half hours in the virtual classroom each week _and_ one hour participating in interactive online activities via Blackboard and other online platforms.

## COURSE EXPECTATIONS, ASSESSMENT & RESOURCES

### Attendance

1. Class attendance is required. **More than 2 unexcused absences may result in a grade of No Credit/<B**. If you anticipate missing more than 2 classes, please inform the professor immediately.

2. Classes missed for religious reasons are excused. Please inform the professor in advance so a plan can be made to make up for missed work.

3. On-time class attendance is expected and appreciated.

### Technology

This online class is designed with the assumption that students will access it through either a desktop or laptop computer, and make use of various interactive tools and software platforms to ensure a high degree of interactivity. Tablets may be able to perform all functions, but access to some may be limited. A smartphone will not be able to perform all functions required for synchronous classes.

### Instructor’s Policy on Using Generative AI in Your Work

*Adapted from Boris Steipe’s [The Sentient Syllabus Project](http://sentientsyllabus.org/)*

Generative AI (Artificial Intelligence that can produce content) is now widely available to produce text, images, and other media. I encourage the use of such AI resources to inform yourself about the field, to understand the contributions that AI can make, and to help your learning and writing. However, keep the following three principles in mind: (1) An AI cannot pass this course; (2) AI contributions must be attributed and true; (3) The use of AI resources must be open and documented.  

1. AI-generated submissions cannot achieve a passing grade. This is necessary to ensure you are competent to surpass generative AI in the future – whether in academia, research, the workplace, or other domains of society.

2. You are taking full responsibility for AI-generated materials as if you had produced them yourself: its ideas must be attributed, and its facts must be true.

3. If you use AI to help your learning and writing, you must be open about your use and document it clearly. Failure to do so will constitute academic dishonesty under Hunter College/CUNY policy.

## Assignments

### Completion of _all_ required readings, media, and activities

This course requires that you read all assigned material, actively contribute to collaborative annotation using Hypothesis, and come to class prepared to critically engage in a discussion that is informed by your reading. *(Please note, all readings, aside from websites, are available on Blackboard, separated by week, and should be collaboratively annotated through Hypothesis).*

**Suggested** readings are not required but may be of interest, and we may draw from them in class discussions.

You will often be given short prompts to prepare for class, such as browsing a particular website or reflecting on your experiences or perceptions of a specific topic. These do not have to be submitted but are designed to help you come to class ready for discussion. They may also help you with developing journal submissions.

### Social annotation co-leads/class discussants

From weeks 2-11, students will be expected to **“co-lead”** social annotation for a week in small groups (of 2-3) in coordination with your Instructor. The purpose is to monitor discussion and engagement in Hypothesis, and to summarize main points to be ready to bring up in discussion. Each group will then come prepared to class to help facilitate discussion and connections across the readings.

Points to consider as social annotation co-leads:

| Aspect | Questions |
|-- |--|
| Central question(s) of the article/chapter | _What are the author(s) trying to answer?_ |
| Key argument(s) of the article/chapter | _What are their main claims?_|
| Key findings of the article/chapter | _What evidence do they use?<br>What are the implications of their findings?_ |
| Audience for the article/chapter | _Who does the imagined audience seem to be?<br>Who do the authors seem to be in dialogue with?_ |
| Relevance to social work | _How does, or how might, this relate to social work practice? <br>How might it not ‘fit’ with social work practice or create conflict?_ |
| Discussion questions | _What are the major points of discussion or questions that come up in annotation?<br>What are your questions?_|
| Links to other materials and units | _Whose other work or ideas does this connect with for you?_|

#### Tips for co-lead/discussants
- Divide up the readings; for longer readings, split sections.
- Check-in before class and plan ahead.
- A presentation or slides are not necessary but might help organize your time.
- Communicate with me if you’re facing any challenges.

### Completion of journals

Students are expected to keep a journal over the course of this class, to reflect on their interactions with and perceptions of the many meanings of ‘homelessness’ in their lives and field practice outside of class. It is recommended to use a digital writing tool, such as [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [LogSeq](https://logseq.com/), or a simple text editor to keep regular notes.

**Students are expected to submit two ~~three~~ entries over the course of the semester of their choosing**, uploaded through BlackBoard. Students should write roughly _750-1000 words (3-4 pages in APA formatting - double-spaced, Times New Roman font)_.

These journals are to document the ways in which our perceptions of homelessness are mediated and structured, and to bring the information we review in class in dialogue with our everyday lives. They are also an opportunity to grapple with questions about the readings and class materials, and dig deeper into something you find particularly interesting. This gives us a chance to test and challenge what we explore in class, and an opportunity to develop a reflective writing practice independent of organizational demands and constraints. I will offer some journal prompts in BlackBoard as inspiration.

### Completion of group paper (or digital project) & presentation

#### Paper (or digital project):
This course requires the completion of one group paper (or digital project), approximately 15 pages (or approximately 3750 words) in length. There will be seven ~~six~~ randomly assigned groups, each of which will select a topic of interest based on a specific dimension of homelessness in New York City (a sub-population, a policy, a service, an intersectional issue, a controversial issue, etc). The paper (or digital project) is due, in BlackBoard, on the morning of the final class. **Students who do not turn the paper in by this date will receive an incomplete.**

#### Group topic proposals

Brief proposals (a 250-500 word abstract) of each group’s topic will be due July 7th ~~June 28th~~. The proposals should state the issue your group is focusing on, your work plan, and the approach you imagine (paper, project, etc). One member each team should email them to me from your Hunter email address, copying your teammates.

#### Paper option

The group paper assignment is as follows:

- **Part 1:** In 5 pages (or approximately 1250 words), discuss and introduce your particular problem or area that intersects with homelessness. Describe your data sources, their assumptions, and limitations. Be certain to discuss, briefly, their relation to the larger homeless population and structural issues that contribute to homelessness as a problem in contemporary society;

- **Part 2:** In 5 pages (or approximately 1250 words), discuss how federal and local policy has sought to intervene in the circumstances of the homeless population subset (or issue) you have chosen;

- **Part 3:** In 5 pages (or approximately 1250 words), discuss what population or issue-specific resources are currently available to this population (or related to this issue) in New York City & the entry-points for said resources. Discuss, as well, any current legislation in New York City, New York State, or US Congress pertaining to this issue, as well as any campaigns and advocacy groups that are actively organizing around the issue.

or

#### Digital project option

For a digital project alternative, you must create a project that is substantively equivalent to a paper. This could include a website, an online resource, a social media campaign, a series of advocacy tools, a film (or series of short videos), or something similar, with a written reflection documenting and analyzing your process (including initial ideas, changes made, limitations, and what you would have done differently with more time). In the event that a group wishes to do a digital project, I will work with you on a proposal.

#### Presentation:
Each group will be given 30 minutes to present their paper and lead a discussion on the findings from the paper with the rest of the class. Ideally, this would be half presentation and half discussion (15 minutes each).

### Participation and Citizenship

Students are expected to be active participants in synchronous and asynchronous online activities. There will be ample opportunity for smaller group and collective activities in class. It is expected that we will treat each other with kindness, curiosity, and empathy. We should feel free to ask questions in good faith and seek clarification on any miscommunications or differences of perspective. We are a learning community.

Forms of participation:

- Sustained attention to class
- Contribution to class discussion
- Contribution to online discussion
- Contribution to Hypothesis annotations
- Active listening and holding space for others

### GRADING

Grading criteria for the School as a whole are spelled out in the Student Handbook. For this course, your grasp of the course content will be reflected through your attendance, demonstrated use of the readings, meaningful involvement in group and class discussions/presentations, timely participation in online discussions, and satisfactory completion of assignments. There is no term paper or final exam for this course.

Students must turn in all assignments. Absent completion of all assignments, students will receive an ‘Incomplete’ grade.

For this class, credit is divided as follows:

- Attendance, Participation, and Class Citizenship (including Hypothesis): 30%
- Journals: 30%
- Article Annotations/Discussion Prompts: 15%
- Group Paper & Presentation: 25%

### Honors (97.5 ≥):
Indicates consistently outstanding achievement equivalent to an A+ or better. It reflects work that meets all of the requirements for a grade of Credit but that, in addition, demonstrates exceptional capacity for critical thinking which includes the contextualization, synthesis of main issues, integration of ideas from several readings, recognition of debated points, and creative application of material to practice and contemporary policy issues.

### Credit (82.5-97.4):
Indicates an acceptable graduate-level work equivalent to a B or better. It reflects a combination of satisfactory completion of all course work**,** the quality of written and oral communication, adequate class participation, and regular and on-time class attendance. This includes ability to accurately report on the content of the readings, to identify main ideas, to draw relevant conclusions, to self- reflect on the material, to apply material to practice and contemporary policy issues and to reference assigned readings, Grades of Credit are given for work within the A to B Range.

### No Credit (< 82.5):
A grade of no-credit indicates a combination of poor quality of work on assignments; insufficient mastery of reading and lecture materials, weak descriptive and conceptual skills, minimal class participation; and excessive absences or lateness. No Credit grades are given to work that is determined to be below a grade of B.

### Incomplete:
Grades of Incomplete may be given at the discretion of the instructor. Instructor and student must agree to a date for completion of the work. Failure to meet the agreed upon date will result in an automatic No Credit. Students who do not achieve Credit level work at the end of a course may not receive an incomplete grade.

### Requests for a Letter Grade:
Requests for a letter grade must be submitted to the instructor electronically no later than the second week of the semester. The request of a letter grade cannot be rescinded.

## COURSE MATERIALS

_This syllabus is subject to change according to class needs and instructor discretion._

### Course logic

This course takes an interdisciplinary lens to address homelessness as a **wicked problem** that social work cannot effectively address in isolation from larger social and political issues. This includes poverty, housing affordability, racism, settler colonialism, patriarchy, heterosexism, and myriad other systemic forms of oppression.

Each class will address three co-occurring themes:

1. Practice perspectives on homelessness from the field (often through guest speakers and reflective discussions).
2. Academic studies focused on the understanding of homelessness and policy history of homelessness and housing in the United States and New York City, with some comparative international perspectives.
3. Media and aesthetic representations and imaginaries regarding homelessness as a social ‘problem’, and the lives persons experiencing homeless.

Our overall goal is to synthesize practice wisdom, policy expertise, and an ongoing commitment to critically interrogate how homelessness is constructed in our everyday lives. To this end, I aim to develop a classroom community that encourages curiosity, empathy, and critical thinking.
