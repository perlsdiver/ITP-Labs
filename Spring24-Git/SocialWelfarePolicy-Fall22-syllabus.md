## COURSE DESCRIPTION

Circumstances that give rise to social problems and their policy solutions; frameworks for analyzing these developments; values and skills needed to understand social policy and engage in advocacy and social change are stressed.

## EXPANDED DESCRIPTION

This foundation course furnishes you with the orienting knowledge and skills needed to examine social welfare policies and to understand their relevance to social service delivery and social work practice. Drawing on liberal arts knowledge, Social Welfare Policy and Services I contextualizes social welfare policy and the social work profession, historically, conceptually, and ideologically. You will become familiar with basic issues, concepts, values, terminology, frameworks and ethical issues that define social welfare policy and that influence their ability to work with diverse groups and populations at risk and to think critically. This course exposes you to knowledge about family life, the market economy, government policies and other social structures that may or may not meet basic human needs, promote social and economic justice or recognize human rights. It alerts you to social welfare policy's contribution to both oppression and social justice and explores how you and your social work colleagues can work to support but also to change the social welfare system.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES

1. Formulate a working definition of social welfare policy (EPAS 2.1.9)
2. Identify, examine and critique the ideological perspectives that shape social policy (EPAS 2.1.5)
3. Examine the ways in which social policy influences service provision and direct practice (both micro and macro) (EPAS 2.1.9)
4. Apply multiple analytic frames to understand how social welfare policy impacts diverse groups and populations and can help or hinder social and economic justice (EPAS 2.1.5)
5. Recognize the interaction between social welfare policy and the wider social, economic and political context (EPAS 2.1.9)
6. Integrate the ways in which the dynamics of race, class and gender affect the formation, impact and outcome of social welfare policy (EPAS 2.1.5)
7. Analyze and explain the relationship between social policy, social change, and effective social work services. (EPAS 2.1.8)

## COURSE FORMAT

## COURSE EXPECTATIONS, ASSESSMENT & RESOURCES

Policy is a complex topic that has its own academic discipline; here our main task is to explore and familiarize ourselves with some of the major debates and their relevance to social work. Regardless of your desired role in social work (micro, mezzo, macro, or a mix), to be an effective social worker you will need to maintain an awareness of how policy impacts your practice, and how your practice can impact policy. This course will give you an opportunity to clarify, discuss, and think critically about the course materials and issues discussed in class. As your professor, I will facilitate discussions, help explain the material, answer questions, and provide feedback on your work. We will spend much of our time learning from each other through discussion. It is **_imperative_** that you come to class **_prepared to discuss_ _the material_** and having **_completed the readings and other assigned media_**.

### Statement of Teaching Philosophy

My role as your instructor is to facilitate your intellectual growth, and to grow along with you. I do this by fostering an interactive classroom and virtual setting that encourages open thinking. I aim to minimize the pressure you may feel to present the “right” answer to questions, so you can explore how you think about something, and develop your skills in supporting your claims with evidence and solid analysis. Your growth in this course also comes through your written and creative assignments; my role is to review and provide substantive feedback. As peers, I expect you to provide constructive feedback to one another as well.

I believe it is important to preserve the complexity of debates and discussions around these issues, and so I often seek to present additional perspectives, theories, and disciplinary approaches beyond social work, that may be useful for your growth. The readings and other materials provide background for open-ended exploration and discussion.

I am also here to facilitate a community, grounded by shared purpose and a commitment to keeping one another safe enough, both emotionally and physically, to learn together. As a group, we can decide upon the norms and rules that work best for us. It is my hope that we can all work together to create a class where we can learn from each other and engage in critical dialogue in a relaxed, supportive, and respectful environment. I expect everyone to help create a learning space where we can all feel comfortable sharing our diverse ideas and viewpoints, as well as exploring ideas and viewpoints we may not be familiar with. I want everyone to feel comfortable stretching themselves and thinking through the implications of viewpoints that differ from one’s own.

I believe that learning is a collaborative endeavor and I am prepared to do all that I can to make this course helpful for you. I am **_always_** open to suggestions and I encourage you to give me feedback on the course in person or via email. Midway through the semester you will have the opportunity to complete an evaluation on the course and offer suggestions on how to improve class. At the end of the semester you will have another opportunity to evaluate the course and my teaching. All evaluations will be anonymous, but completion of evaluations are expected.

Compares and contrasts major views of social welfare policy (i.e., neoliberalism/conservatism, liberalism, social democratic) that have influenced both the definition of social problems and social welfare policies enacted to address them. Introduces criteria used to distinguish between these perspectives such as their competing views regarding human nature, the family, the market economy, the role of government and the process of social change among others. Encourages you to locate your own ideological voice and to identify that of others.

### **PART IV. SOCIAL MOVEMENTS, SOCIAL POLICY, AND SOCIAL CHANGE**

Unit XII. This unit examines the evolution and effectiveness of contemporary social movements in their efforts to make social change. Specifically, this unit will examine two social movements – Black Lives Matter and Me Too. These movements have emerged to challenge, respectively, racist police practices and institutional racism, and sexual violence and harassment. Students will trace how these movements began and examine how these movements are different from past movements, the social change strategies and tactics used, and consider how social work can contribute to solving the problems these movements are designed to address.
