# Lesson Notes

These are the instructions for the ITP Skills Lab on Git and Github.

## Lesson Plan

We will use this workshop as the primary pedagogical tool, the Digital Humanities Infrastructure for Teaching Technology, developed by the Graduate Center Digital Initiatives:

## Notes on Modifying Lesson Plan

This lesson plan is designed with the assumption that participants are using their personal computers, or ones where they have full administrative access to install software and configure Git. It is also designed with the assumption that participants have installed Visual Studio Code onto their computers.

If they do not have appropriate permissions in their computers, and do not have VS Code, the lesson can be modified to focus on Github, skipping the Git settings and staging a commit. In this instance, participants can use GitHub in their browser after creating a free educational account.

## Examples

Some intertesting uses of GitHub that may give you some ideas

[Notation and Thought](https://github.com/kai-qu/notation), a collection of excerpts about notation systems and how they influence cognition.

[Art of README](https://github.com/hackergrrl/art-of-readme), an entire repo and letter about writing a good README file.

[Tacofancy](https://github.com/dansinker/tacofancy), a collaborative taco recipe.

[Hacker Zines](https://github.com/apertureless/hacker-zines), a collection of old hacker zines in text files.

[chatGPT Source Watch](https://github.com/0xdevalias/chatgpt-source-watch), a tracker of changes to chatGPT's code base.
