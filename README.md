# ITP Labs
Skills Labs for Interactive Technology and Pedagogy.

This repository contains information and exercises for the [Certificate Program in Interactive Technology and Pedagogy](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/interactive-technology-and-pedagogy) at the CUNY Graduate Center.

## Fall 2023: Introduction to HMTL & CSS

This workshop was adapted from ITP Skills Lab materials developed by Zachary Mulhbauer [@zmuhls](https://github.com/zmuhls), PhD Candidate in English at the CUNY Graduate Center Coordinator for Education & Support for OpenCUNY. Slides for the workshop are contained within the "Fall23-HTMLCSS" folder.

I was hired later in Fall 2023 to rewrite and overhaul the Digital Humanities Infrastructure for Teaching Technology (DHRIFT) [lesson on HTML and CSS](https://app.dhrift.org/dynamic/?user=GC-DRI&repo=DRI24&file=html-css&instUser=GC-DRI&instRepo=GCDRI24Schedule) for the Graduate Center Digital Humanities Research Institute 2024, so I recommend using that resource if you are looking to learn about HTML and CSS.

## Spring 2024: Introduction to Git and Github

This workshop follows the Digital Humanities Infrastructure for Teaching Technology (DHRIFT) [lesson on Git and Github](https://app.dhrift.org/dynamic/?user=GC-DRI&repo=DRI24&file=git&instUser=GC-DRI&instRepo=GCDRI24Schedule) from the Graduate Center Digital Research Institute 2024. The code repo for this can be accessed here.

Some supplemental materials for the workshop are contained within the [SPRING24-Git](https://github.com/perlsdiver/ITP-Labs/tree/main/Spring24-Git) folder, which I will update with feedback from workshop participants. One example is a [syllabus](https://github.com/perlsdiver/ITP-Labs/blob/main/Spring24-Git/HP23-syllabus.md) I converted from Microsoft Word to Markdown, then lightly edited.
